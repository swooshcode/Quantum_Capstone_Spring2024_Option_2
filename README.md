# Quantum Capstone Spring2024: Option 2

This Python script decodes messages encrypted using a simple Caesar cipher, supporting both uppercase and lowercase letters. It reads an input message from a file, decrypts it using the Caesar cipher, and outputs the decoded message. After extraction of the encrypted messages, the script retains the letter casing (lowercase/uppercase) during decryption. The ouput will be the decoded message. Here's how it works: 

Step 1: git clone repo
Step 2: cd repo
Step 3: npm i 
Step 4: cd main.py
Step 5: python main.py (must have python installed on your computer)
